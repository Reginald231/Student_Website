Some files from a website I was assigned to create for my Internet Programming Class in the Fall semester of 2020. Some of the files included are not on the main website as it was not necessary to upload them; however, they are still included as reference to my work. A GitHub pages form of the website I created for myself can be found here: https://reginald231.github.io/Student_Website/
