  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <!-- Adding info about self here -->
  <p>Born and raised in Georgia, I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science major at Kennesaw State
    University. I have always been very interested in how things work and why they work. This trait eventually
    grew larger as I looked deeper into technology and found myself even <b>more</b> fascinated.
    I'm that guy that has a <i>million questions.</i> I am also currently pursuing internship opportunities
    (preferably virtual) as I prepare myself for the professional workplace and atmosphere. These are
    the CS-related classes I have taken (or am enrolled in) so far:
  </p>

  <!-- Completed or enrolled classes. -->
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Programming Principles 1 and 2 (Java)</li>
    <li>Introduction to Software Engineering</li>
    <li>Introduction to Database Systems</li>
    <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
    <li>Data Structures</li>
    <li>Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Computer Organization and Architechture</li>
    <li>Internet Programming</li>
    <li>Concepts of Programming Languages</li>
    <li>Algorithm Analysis</li>
    <li>Linear Algebra</li>
    <li>Software Testing and Quality Assurance</li>
    <li>Software Architecture and Design</li>
    <li>Technical Writing<li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is actually my first use of HTML and JavaScript as I have had <em>no</em> other
    experience with web development. However, I have used other
    languages including:
  </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Swift</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>SQLite</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Helpful Links and References</h3>

  <p>A GitHub page showing my growth in programming can be found
    <em><a href="https://www.github.com/reginald231">here.</a></em>if you are
    interested.
  </p>

  <p>If you want to start programming in HTML, I found
    <em><a href="https://www.html.com">
        this website</a></em> quite easy to understand while I was creating this
    page.
  </p>

  <p>I remembered that our Internet Programming class will be using Django in the
    future, so I'll leave a link to a helpful YouTube channel I watch from time to
    time. I originally found this channel while searhing for Python programming
    tutorials, and I noticed that he has also covered Django, so I believe this
    will be a great help for later (and a great help now if any visitors of
    my page wish to teach themselves Python). You can find the channel
    (Tech With Tim)
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg"><em>here.
      </em></a>
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.GeeksforGeeks.org">GeeksforGeeks</a> is also a great
    resource for understanding programming concepts in general such as data structures
    and algorithms. They've helped me a lot in the past and I'm sure the site will
    be of good use in the future.
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> and the subreddit,
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">r/learnprogramming</a>, are
    good resources for troubleshooting issues in code. More specifically,
    r/learnprogramming is a more informal community that is willing to answer
    programming related questions and give helpful advice. I've found myself
    traversing both of these sites frequently.
